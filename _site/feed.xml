&lt;p&gt;Hack.lu is an annual conference held in Luxembourg, focused on topics related to computer security, cryptography, privacy, and hacking. Since its inception in 2005, Hack.lu has been bringing together experts from all around the world to discuss the latest trends, techniques, and challenges in the field of cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, the two conferences will take place from October 16th to 19th at the Parc Hotel Alvisse in Luxembourg. Hack.lu 2023, from October 18th to 19th, will feature a diverse range of talks and workshops, covering topics such as cybercrime, malware analysis, network security, reverse engineering, and more. You’ll also have the opportunity to network with like-minded professionals, connect with industry leaders, and learn about the latest security tools and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Hack.lu, we are also proud to present the CTI-Summit, a sister event focused on Cyber Threat Intelligence. The CTI-Summit will take place from October 16th to 17th, the days before Hack.lu, and will provide a platform for experts to discuss the latest trends and developments in the world of threat intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also have a wide range of trainings and workshops during the four conference days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the CTI-Summit, you’ll have the opportunity to learn about the latest techniques and strategies for collecting, analyzing, and sharing threat intelligence. You’ll hear from leading experts in the field, participate in hands-on workshops, and network with peers from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We invite you to join us at both Hack.lu and the CTI-Summit and be a part of this unique opportunity to learn from the best and brightest in the cybersecurity industry. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting out, Hack.lu and the CTI-Summit offer something for everyone. Register today and secure your spot at the premier cybersecurity event of the year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber and Threat Intelligence Summit 2022 (CTIS) is a 2-day summit gathering all the experts, analysts, users and contributors to cyber and threat intelligence at large. CTIS includes the original MISP summit along with all other practices around threat intelligence. A strong focus will be given on projects bridging intelligence communities together and also open source related project. The conference will be a main track of talks composed of one day for intelligence (models, processes, methodologies, defensive and sharing practices…) and one day for tooling (threat intelligence platform such as MISP, interconnecting tools and processes, producing actionable intelligence… ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;date-and-location&quot;&gt;Date and location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CTIS conference takes physically place in Luxembourg (October 16 - 17 2023) at the

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hacklu&quot;&gt;hack.lu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the hack.lu convention is to give an open and free playground where people can discuss the implication of new technologies in society. hack.lu is a balanced mix convention where technical and non-technical people can meet each others and share freely all kind of information. The convention will be held in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg in October (18-19.10.2023). The most significant new discoveries about computer network attacks and defences, open-source security solutions, and pragmatic real world security experience will be presented in a three days series of informative tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to invite you to to submit papers, lightning talk, and workshops proposals for selection by the hack.lu technical review committee.&lt;/p&gt;
